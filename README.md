# SpoilerJS

SpoilerJS is a lightweight microplugin written in pure JavaScript (so without dependencies) to hide text,
images or anything HTML code to your users adding a simple tag class "spoiler".

SpoilerJS shows a tag at the begining of the spoiler element to user makes click to show it.
This tag is a toggle tag so you can hide another time.

It's very simple to use:

1. Add class name "spoiler" to HTML elements you want hide (blured).
2. Add script at the end of your HTML document.
```    <script type="text/javascript" src="lib/config.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="lib/spoilers.js"></script>```
3. That's all. :)
